We also run our own "Platform as a Service" offering called "APPUiO". We've created our own suite of tools to manage lots of Kubernetes services from a central location, called "Project Syn". Last but not least, we have developed our own Kubernetes operator for backups, called K8up, which just like Project Syn is 100% open source on GitHub.
