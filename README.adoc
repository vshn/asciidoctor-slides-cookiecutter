= Reveal.js Presentation Template

Fork this project to bootstrap your next presentation!

== Requisites

This presentation is built from Asciidoc sources using the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-revealjs/[Asciidoctor Reveal.js] integration.

It requires Node.js (version 10 or higher) and npm (version 6 or higher). It is recommended to use the https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm[Node Version Manager] to install them.

== Build

Use the command `make` to build the presentation file. The new file `slides.html` is your presentation, to be open with any standards-compliant browser. This task also creates a `slides.pdf` file, ready to be shared.

== Docker

Run `docker-compose up --build` and open your browser at http://localhost:8080/ to see the presentation. The PDF slides are located at the URL http://localhost:8080/slides.pdf ready to be downloaded.

TIP: Leaving out the `d` flag enables you to easily start/stop the presentation with a rebuild in between, for easier development.
